## Git vs. GitHub
#### Git
Git allows you to do version control on your IDE and does not require a connection to the internet. Version control is the ability to save certain parts of your code or all of it if you want to. The best part of git is that it allows you to only revert a certian part of your code and keep everthing else that you currently have.
#### GitHub
Stores code in the cloud and visually keeps track of code. GitHub also alows you to colaborate with others in multiple ways. One of the many things github allows is cloning which copies the code from a repo to your local. An alternative to this is forking which rather than just getting a copy of the repo, it makes an entirely seprate repo on github and allows you to push changes to that seprate repo. Repositories on github are called remotes.
